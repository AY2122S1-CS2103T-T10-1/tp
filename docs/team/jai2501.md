### Project: CohortConnect

CohortConnect - CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

With advanced features for managing large groups of contacts, CohortConnect is intended for use in a university setting. At the start of the semester, professors will distribute csv or json files containing a list of students. Instantly load them into CohortConnect with a single Import command. With data collected from students before the semester, our Find A Buddy feature helps you find potential groupmates by leveraging GitHubâ€™s metadata using a proprietary algorithm. In the Events tab, you can identify events and hackathons that your peers will be attending.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Created the Welcome Splash Screen.
  * What it does: When the app is launched, the user is greeted with a Welcome Splash Screen. It shows our app logo and motto with a typewriter and fading effect.
  * Justification: To enhance the overall experience with the app.
  * Credits: *JavaFX library is utilized.*

* **Updated Feature**: Updated the Help Window, with a better UI - a darker theme. Added the list of commands supported by the app for quick access. Also added a `visit URL` button, which when clicked open, opens the User Guide in the Web Browser.
  * Justification: This allows the user to quickly refer to any command they don't recall, without the fuss of leaving the app, and having to read the User Guide.
  * Highlights: The darker themed UI, with a red highlight when the mouse is hovered above any command, enhances the usability of the app.
  * Credits: *JavaFX library is utilized.*
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Jai2501&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
