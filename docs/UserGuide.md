CohortConnect is a desktop application for CS students to network, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Our app makes it easy to connect with like minded students in your module. Our **Find A Buddy** feature matches you with students who have similar interests by leveraging Githubâ€™s metadata using a proprietary algorithm.
