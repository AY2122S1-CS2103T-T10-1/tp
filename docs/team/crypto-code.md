## Project: CohortConnect

CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Features

* **Show Command**:
    * Pull requests [\#40](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/40) and [\#65](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/65)
    * What it does: Allows user to view details of a user using the Show command by the index, name, github username or telegram id.
    * Justification: This feature allows for a clean UI and displaying details of the chosen Student only.
    * Highlights: The implementation too was challenging as it required interconnecting the ModelManager with the PersonListPanel.


* **Added the Find A Buddy Feature**
    * Pull request [\#137](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/137)
    * What it does: Allows user to get the top 5 matches based on GitHub similarities.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user will be able to find teammates with similarities.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is central to the app's use. It required an in-depth analysis of similarity metrics. The implementation too was challenging as it required applying Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance and Cosine Similarity.
    * Credits: The distance metrics were researched [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/17-types-of-similarity-and-dissimilarity-measures-used-in-data-science-3eb914d2681)
